# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Task to create an app in React Native. Due to stressful week I went very basic and createad a step counter by using sensor "Pedometer". 

## The problem

Challenging to understand what libraries and dependencies to use. Had problems in the begining to even start the project due to technical issues. If I would have had more time this week I would have put more energy into styling and make the app a bit more complex. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
